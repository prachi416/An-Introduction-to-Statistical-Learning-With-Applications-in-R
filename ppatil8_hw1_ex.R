##Summery: 
#Average acceptance rate of the colleges is around 74%
#Average graduation rate of the given colleges is around 65%
#Elite universities have higher amount of Ph.D. professors as compared to other universities
#Elite universities have slightly higher Graduation rate as compared to other universities but the spread of Graduation rate is almost similar
#The cost of Books is almost constant whereas the Room/Board cost varies
#The Instructional Expenditure increases linearly with Out-Of-State Tuition
#Mean Instructional Expenditure per student increases with the Graduation rate

#Mileage decreases with the increse in number of cylinders

#The heatmap shows the correlation between parameters. 
#From the correlation between variables, it can be inferred that the gas Mileage is inversely proportional to Horsepower, Displacement, Weight.
#Gas Mileage is increases with the increase in acceleration.
#The Gas Mileage tend to increase with upcoming years. 
#Gas Mileage for Origin 1 is lower as compared to Origin 2 and 3. 
#Hence factors including Year, Acceleration, Displacement, Weight, Horsepower, Country of Origin are useful in predicting Gas Mileage.
